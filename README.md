Description
-----------
This is a slightly modified edition of the GLEW library (v1.11.0), created with pre-generated source code and adapted for static linking and for being served over biicode. I am not the author of the original version of this library (please see below and also, read the license).

Compatibility
-------------
This block has been successfully tested on the following configurations:

- Debian Wheezy
- Windows 8
- OS X Mavericks

I am pretty sure that it will work on many other systems as well, but please let me know if that is not the case.

Original Version
----------------
The original version of the library can be found at the following locations:

- http://glew.sourceforge.net/
- https://github.com/nigels-com/glew
