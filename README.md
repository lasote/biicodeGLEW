The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW)
============================================

For requests for assistance, comments and suggestions, please open an issue on the project's source code repository: https://github.com/dimitrikourk/biicodeGLEW/issues

This is a slightly modified edition of the GLEW library (v1.11.0), created with pre-generated source code and adapted for static linking and for being served over biicode. I am not the author of this library (please see below and also read the license).

The original version of the library can be found at the following locations:

http://glew.sourceforge.net/

https://github.com/nigels-com/glew

In order to use the block, include **dimitrikourk/glew/glew.h** in your source code, and make sure your project already links to OpenGL (either via CMakeLists.txt, or by using another block like miguel/sdl2 or diego/glfw)

Block on biicode: http://www.biicode.com/dimitrikourk/dimitrikourk/glew/master
